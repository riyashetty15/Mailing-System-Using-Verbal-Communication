# Mailing-System-Using-Verbal-Communication
This project aims to revolutionize email accessibility for visually impaired individuals, offering a seamless and intuitive email experience. The goal of this project is to create an application that eliminates the need for keyboard shortcuts or knowledge of key locations, making email communication accessible to all.

### Overview
This Android application utilizes voice commands to navigate and utilize email facilities effortlessly. By integrating Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, it enable users to interact with their emails using natural language processing. Additionally, I've employed text summarization techniques to assist users in attaching files, providing concise summaries for easy selection.

### Features
**Voice-Based Navigation**: Users can navigate the application and perform email actions using simple voice commands. <br>
**TTS and STT Integration**: TTS reads out emails, while STT converts spoken words into text for composing messages.<br>
**Text Summarization**: The TF-IDF algorithm generates summaries of files, aiding users in selecting attachments.<br>
**User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides clear instructions and guidance, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.<br>

### Methodology

**Authentication**: Users authenticate their Gmail accounts using the Gmail API, ensuring secure access.<br>
**Email Composition**: Users can compose emails using voice commands, with STT converting speech to text.<br>
**File Attachment**: The application generates summaries of available files, allowing users to attach files using voice commands.<br>
**Email Reading**: TTS reads out received emails, providing an accessible way to consume email content.<br>

### Scope and Impact
This project aims to empower visually impaired users and bridge the digital divide. By eliminating the reliance on keyboards and visual cues, making email communication accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, this application can benefit individuals with reading difficulties, offering an alternative way to interact with emails.

### Result
To demonstrate the real-world applicability of this solution, I hosted the Voice-Enabled Email Companion on Heroku for a limited time. This brief hosting period allowed us to gather valuable user feedback and showcase the application's usability and impact. Although the hosting was temporary, it left a lasting impression and highlighted the potential for widespread adoption.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to extend my gratitude to my mentors and the research community for their guidance and support. This project is a step towards creating a more inclusive digital world, and I hope it inspires further innovations in accessibility.
