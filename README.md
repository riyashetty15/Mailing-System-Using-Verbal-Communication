# Mailing-System-Using-Verbal-Communication
In this Andoid Application we will be developing a voice-based email system which will aid the visually impaired people who are na√Øve to computer systems to use email facilities in a hassle-free manner. The users of this system would not need to have any basic information regarding keyboard shortcuts or where the keys are located. All functions are based on simple voice commands making it very easy for any type of user to use this system. Also, the user need not worry about remembering which mouse click operation needs to be performed in order to avail a given service as the system itself will be promoting them as to which click will provide them with what operations.
